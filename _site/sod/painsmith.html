      <h1 id="phase-1">Phase 1</h1>

<p>This phase is a lot of rinse and repeat where we get to learn the basic movements that occur throughout the encounter.  We want to push out of this phase at about the 2 minute mark.  If we approach 70% before the 2 minute mark we’re going to stop DPS.  There will be a set of balls at ~1:45 and an Axe throw at ~2:00.</p>

<h2 id="base-setup">Base Setup</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/painsmith/painsmith_p1_base.jpg" alt="Base Setup" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Boss is tanked at bottom left corner</li>
  <li>Axe is taken to top right corner</li>
  <li>This creates a 5x5 safe zone for the raid to stand in</li>
  <li>Reset to this position after mechanics are over</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chains">Chains</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/painsmith/painsmith_p1_chains.jpg" alt="Chains" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Chains go to your designated marker in the center</li>
  <li>You can move directly to them in P1</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spikes-from-axe">Spikes From Axe</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/painsmith/painsmith_p1_spikes.jpg" alt="Spikes" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Spikes come out in all directions in a 3x3 from the target of Axe</li>
  <li>Spikes also come out in all directions in a 1x1 from all players with chains</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spiked-balls">Spiked Balls</h2>

<h3 id="targeting">Targeting</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/painsmith/painsmith_p1_balls_targeting.jpg" alt="Targeting" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Spawn directions are still random like on the other difficulties</li>
  <li>We’re going to kill the spiked ball that spawns in the nearest corner to the raid</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/painsmith/painsmith_p1_balls_movement.jpg" alt="Movement" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Chains should only move in straight lines perpendicular to the spiked balls until the raid has passed through safely</li>
  <li>If chained players have a blink, they should use it to get across (still staying in their perpendicular lane)</li>
  <li>The rest of the raid will run up to the nearest spiked ball along the edge and kill it</li>
  <li>Melee be careful to stay at max melee range and walk backwards as you’re killing the spiked ball</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="traps">Traps</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/painsmith/painsmith_p1_traps.jpg" alt="Traps" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Traps are placed behind the raid along the edge</li>
  <li>Do. Not. Touch. Traps.  The RL will handle them, either by doing them or by calling out someone by name to break them one by one</li>
</ul>
